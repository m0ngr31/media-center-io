# Media-Center.io

This is the source code for media-center.io.

I don't recommend running this as it's own service. Please look at my other [repo](https://github.com/m0ngr31/kodi-alexa) if you are wanting to self-host the Media Center skill.

If you are really dedicated, look at the source and the `./run.sh.example` files to see what environment variables you'll need to get started.
